- Maintaining compatibility with full **Symantec Endpoint Encryption deployments** within an organization.  
- Protecting against **data leakage** by ensuring all external storage remains encrypted and controlled.  
- Reducing risk from lost or stolen devices by keeping sensitive files unreadable to unauthorized users.

It is considered a vital component of modern **data loss prevention (DLP)** strategies, giving enterprises confidence that sensitive assets remain protected regardless of location.
